<!-- HeaDER OUR POLICY -->
<h2>We built the company that we'd want to do business with. We hope you do too.</h2>
<!-- A list of our compoany opolicy 8 numbered items in two columns each with 5 numbered items-->
<div class="left-column">
    <div class="policy">
      <!-- number -->
    <h3>1</h3>
      <!-- header -->
    <h4>Useful is forever</h4>
    <p>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy">
    <h3>2</h3>
    <h4>Great service is everything</h4>
    <p>We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy">
    <h3>3</h3>
    <h4>Clarity is king</h4>
    <p>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy">
    <h3>4</h3>
    <h4>Our customers are our investors</h4>
    <p>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- End of left columns division in the section of our-policy-->

  <div class="policy">

  <h4>The basics are beautiful</h4>
  <p>We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="policy" >
  <h3>6</h3>
  <h4>No hidden fees or secret prices</h4>
  <p>We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="policy">
  <h3>7</h3>
    <h4>Software should be easy</h4>
    <p>Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="policy">
  <h3>8</h3>
    <h4>Long term contracts are obscene</h4>
    <p>No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.</p>
